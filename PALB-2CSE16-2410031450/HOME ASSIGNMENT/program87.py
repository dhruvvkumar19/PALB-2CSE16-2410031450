'''Count pairs of strings with one mismatch
Given an array arr[] of strings of equal length, where each string consists of lowercase
English letters, find the total number of pairs of strings that differ in exactly one
character position.
Note: Two strings differ in exactly one position if they have the same length and differ
in exactly one index that is, all characters except one are the same.'''
